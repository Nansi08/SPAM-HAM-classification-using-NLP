# SPAM-HAM-classification-using-NLP
Spam/Ham classification is a common application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves categorizing text messages (such as SMS or emails) into two classes: spam (unwanted or unsolicited messages) and ham (legitimate messages). This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify messages based on their content.
